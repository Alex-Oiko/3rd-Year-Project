	soma   dendrites  axon

soma--> the body of the neuron
axon-->it is extended from the soma of the neuron. It is usually used to transmit signals
    -->no neuron has more than one axons(human)
    -->they make contact with other neurons or in some cases muscles and glands
    -->can communicate with many other neurons, since it forms a dendritic tree at its end
    -->Axon hillock is the part that connects the soma with the tube of the axon and it is the most easily excited part of the neuron.
dendrites-->receives signals from the soma of the neuron or other neurons
	 -->given the above the input to the neuron is provided by the dendritic tree

SYNAPSE
---------
-how neurons communicate with each other
-a typical synapse is a contanct between the axon of one neuron and a dendrite or soma of another.
-the connection between an axon and a dendrite
-presynaptic part of the synapse-->presynaptic terminal
-postsynaptic part of the synapse-->postsynaptic compartment
-between the 2 there is a liquid filled gap called synaptic cleft


Not useful but cool stuff
---------------------------
-no neurons lack a soma but some might lack an axon or a dendrite
-in addition to the axon dendrite synapses u might have axon-axon and dendrite-dendrite synapses
