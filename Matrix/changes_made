-OpCode is now OpCodes and a vector of unsigned integers. It is also added in a changeable vector and saved into a core. Name is mop
	.Task.h @ its description. instead of havong vector<float>, it is now vector<vectors<<unsigned>
	.Task.cpp @readMatrix(). It tweaked a bit to read the OpCodes 
	.Utils.h @its description. It is described as vector<unsigned> instead of float
	.Core.h @a new vector exists called mop that will save the OpCodes(vectors) to the Core memory
	.Cores.cpp @ AllocateStorage(task...), in order to allocate storage in the respective core, otherwise->seg fault

-Temp vairable in TTE
	.Utils.h @ an extra variable called Temp exists now in the TTE
	.Cores.h @ a new vectors is added to save these variables to hte cores
	.Cores.cpp @ AllocateStorage(), to allocate some memory there
