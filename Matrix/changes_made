-OpCode is now OpCodes and a vector of unsigned integers. It is also added in a changeable vector and saved into a core. Name is mop
	.Task.h @ its description. instead of havong vector<float>, it is now vector<vectors<<unsigned>
	.Task.cpp @readMatrix(). It tweaked a bit to read the OpCodes 
	.Utils.h @its description. It is described as vector<unsigned> instead of float
	.Core.h @a new vector exists called mop that will save the OpCodes(vectors) to the Core memory
	.Cores.cpp @ AllocateStorage(task...), in order to allocate storage in the respective core, otherwise->seg fault

-Temp vairable in TTE
	.Utils.h @ an extra variable called Temp exists now in the TTE
	.Task.h @ description, there is a new vector of type vector<string,float**> called mTemp
	.Task.cpp @ CoreFiller, adds one line to set the corresponding value to the core, in the same principle as the actual value works(mStore vector)
	.Cores.h @ a new vectors is added to save these variables to hte cores
	.Cores.cpp @ AllocateStorage(), to allocate some memory there

-Counter variable in TTE
	.Utils.h @ an extra counter variable exists to count how many receptions have occured in a node, so as to not fire prematurely
	.Task.cpp @ CoreFiller sets the counter variable to 0 for all the cores
	.Core.h @ description there is a new vector called Mcounter<unsigned> to keep all the counters for all the nodes according to the TTE.V pointer that is saved in each TTE
	.Core.cpp @ AllocateStorage, memory is allocated for the Mcounter vector and the respective value(0) is assigned.
