<b>Abstract idea of a queue:</b><p>

The <em>queue</em> is another data structure.  A physical analogy for a
queue is a line at a bank.  When you go to the bank, customers go to
the <em>rear</em> (end) of the line and customers come off of the line
(i.e., are serviced) from the <em>front</em> of the line.

</p><p>
</p><hr align="left" width="20%">
<b>Aside:</b>
In fact, other English-speaking countries use this term for a line,
e.g., they might say "Queue up!" rather than "Get in a line!"
<hr align="left" width="20%">

<p>
Like a stack, a queue usually holds things of the same type.  We
usually draw queues horizontally.  Here's a queue of characters with 3
elements:

</p><blockquote><pre>queue
-------------
| a | b | c |
-------------
  ^       ^
  |       |
front    rear
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The main property of a queue is that objects go on the <em>rear</em>
and come off of the <em>front</em> of the queue.

</p><p>
Here are the minimal set of operations we'd need for an abstract
queue:

</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li><code>Enter</code> (or <code>Insert</code>)
<p>
Places an object at the <em>rear</em> of the queue.

</p><p>
</p></li><li><code>Delete</code> (or <code>Remove</code>)
<p>
Removes an object from the <em>front</em> of the queue and produces
that object.

</p><p>
</p></li><li><code>IsEmpty</code>
<p>
Reports whether the queue is empty or not.

</p></li></ul>

<p>
</p></li><li>
<b><em>Order</em> produced by a queue:</b><p>

</p><p>
Queues are useful because they produce a certain order in which the
contents of the queue are used.  Let's see what order that is by
looking at a queue of characters.

Now, what would a particular sequence of <code>Enter</code> and
<code>Delete</code>s do to this queue:

</p><blockquote><pre>queue
-------------
| a | b | c |
-------------
  ^       ^
  |       |
front    rear
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now, <code>Enter(queue, 'd')</code>...

</p><blockquote><pre>queue
-----------------
| a | b | c | d |
-----------------
  ^           ^
  |           |
front        rear
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now, <code>ch = Delete(queue)</code>...

</p><blockquote><pre>queue           ch
-------------   -----
| b | c | d |   | a |
-------------   -----
  ^       ^
  |       |
front    rear
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You'll notice that the queue enforces a certain <em>order</em> to
the use of its contents.

<em>Is the ordering of the queue <b>Last</b> thing <b>In</b> is the
<b>First</b> thing <b>Out</b> (<strong>LIFO</strong>) or <b>First</b>
Thing <b>In</b> is the <b>First</b> thing <b>Out</b>
(<strong>FIFO</strong>)?</em>

</p><p><b>Answer:</b> <em>Queues</em> produce <b>FIFO</b> order.  Remember
that <em>stacks</em> produce <b>LIFO</b> order.

</p><p>
</p></li><li>
<b>Implementing a queue with an array:</b><p>

Since a queue usually holds a bunch of items with the same type, we
could implement a queue with an array.  Let's simplify our array
implementation of a queue by using an array of a fixed size,
<code>MAX_QUEUE_SIZE</code>.

</p><p>
<em>What other pieces of data would you need (besides an array) to
implement a queue in this way?</em>

</p><p>
One of the things we'll need to keep track of is the number of elements
in the queue, i.e., not all the elements in the array may be holding
elements of the queue at any given time.

</p><p>
So far, the pieces of data we need for our array implementation of
the queue are:

</p><blockquote><pre>an array
a count
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<em>Will these pieces be sufficient?</em>  Let's look at an example
to find out...We'll start with a queue with 3 elements:

</p><blockquote><pre>queue (made up of 'contents' and 'count')
-----------------   -----
| a | b | c |   |   | 3 |
-----------------   -----
  0   1   2   3     count
contents
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
where <b>a</b> is at the <em>front</em> and <b>c</b> is at the
<em>rear</em>.  Now, we <em>enter</em> a new element with:
<nobr><code>Enter(queue, 'd')</code></nobr>...

</p><blockquote><pre>queue (made up of 'contents' and 'count')
-----------------   -----
| a | b | c | d |   | 4 |
-----------------   -----
  0   1   2   3     count
contents
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
All seems well.  How about if we remove an element with:
<nobr><code>ch = Delete(queue)</code></nobr>?...

</p><blockquote><pre>queue (made up of 'contents' and 'count')
-----------------   -----   -----
|   | b | c | d |   | 3 |   | a |
-----------------   -----   -----
  0   1   2   3     count    ch
contents
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Hmmm, we have a problem because the <em>front</em> of the queue is
no longer at array position 0.  One solution would be to move all the
elements down one, giving:

</p><blockquote><pre>queue (made up of 'contents' and 'count')
-----------------   -----
| b | c | d |   |   | 3 |
-----------------   -----
  0   1   2   3     count
contents
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We <strong>reject</strong> that solution though because it is <em>too
expensive</em> to move everything down every time we remove an element.

</p><p>
<em>
Instead, can we use an additional piece of information to keep track
of the <b>front</b>?
</em>

</p><p><b>Answer:</b> Yes!  We can use the index of the element at the
front, giving:

</p><blockquote><pre>queue (made up of 'contents', 'front' and 'count')
-----------------   -----   -----
|   | b | c | d |   | <font color="#ee0000">1 |   | 3 |
-----------------   -----   -----
  0   1   2   3     front   count
contents
</font></pre></blockquote><font color="#ee0000">

<p>
Now, what if we enter another element with:
<nobr><code>Enter(queue, 'e')</code></nobr>?  Currently, the rear of
the queue holds <code>'d'</code> and is at the end of the array.
<em>Where will we put <code>'e'</code>?</em>

</p><p>
We've already said that moving everything down is too expensive.  An
alternative would be to use the array in a <em>circular fashion</em>.
In other words, when we hit the end of the array, we wrap around and
use the beginning.  Now, with this choice for entering
<code>'e'</code>, the fields look like:

</p><blockquote><pre>queue (made up of 'contents', 'front' and 'count')
-----------------   -----   -----
| <font color="#ee0000">e</font> | b | c | d |   | 1 |   | <font color="#ee0000">4</font> |
-----------------   -----   -----
  0   1   2   3     front   count
contents
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<em>
Finally, how would it look like after:
<nobr><code>ch = Delete(queue)</code></nobr>?
</em>

</p><blockquote><pre>queue (made up of 'contents', 'front' and 'count')
-----------------   -----   -----   -----
| e |   | c | d |   | <font color="#ee0000">2</font> |   | <font color="#ee0000">3</font> |   | b |
-----------------   -----   -----   -----
  0   1   2   3     front   count    ch
contents
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
</p></font></li><li><font color="#ee0000">
<b>Alternative representation:</b><p>

As we've seen, one choice for the set of <em>data</em> needed
for the queue is:

</p><blockquote><pre>an array
a front index
a count
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
There is another possibility...Instead, we could replace the
<em>count</em> with the location of the <em>rear</em>, thus using
the following pieces of data:

</p><blockquote><pre>an array
a front index
<font color="#ee0000">a rear index</font>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Then, these pieces of data would reflect the state of the
queue in the following way...Starting out with a queue with
4 elements...

</p><blockquote><pre>queue (made up of 'contents', 'front' and 'rear')
-----------------   -----   -----
| a | b | c | d |   | 0 |   | 3 |
-----------------   -----   -----
  0   1   2   3     front   rear
contents
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now, remove one with <nobr><code>ch = Delete(queue)</code></nobr>, giving:

</p><blockquote><pre>queue (made up of 'contents', 'front' and 'rear')
-----------------   -----   -----
|   | b | c | d |   | <font color="#ee0000">1</font> |   | 3 |
-----------------   -----   -----
  0   1   2   3     front   rear
contents
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now, add one with <nobr><code>Enter(queue, 'e')</code></nobr>, giving:

</p><blockquote><pre>queue (made up of 'contents', 'front' and 'rear')
-----------------   -----   -----
| <font color="#ee0000">e</font> | b | c | d |   | 1 |   | <font color="#ee0000">0</font> |
-----------------   -----   -----
  0   1   2   3     front   rear
contents
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Let's decide which data representation to use.  Since one representation
might make some of the queue functionality <em>conceptually easier</em> to
write, we have to look at the functionality we'll need.

</p><p>
From the generic description of the queue, we know we need, at least:

</p><p>
<code>
</code></p><ul><code>
<li>Enter
</li><li>Delete
</li><li>IsEmpty
</li></code></ul><code>
</code>

<p>
However, since we will be writing this is C, we'll also need things to:

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><code>Create</code> - create a new queue.
</li><li><code>Destroy</code> - destroy the queue when we are done with it.
</li><li><code>IsFull</code> - test for <em>fullness</em> since this is a
queue with a fixed maximum size.
</li></ul>

<p>
Our analysis of the tradeoffs are the following:

</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>Using the <em>count</em> will make <code>IsEmpty()</code> and
<code>IsFull()</code> easy, although we'll have to make sure the count is
updated properly in <code>Enter()</code> and <code>Delete()</code>.
We haven't explored how to determine emptiness/fullness with <em>rear</em>
or whether doing so presents any challenges.

<p>
</p></li><li>Using the <em>count</em> in <code>Enter()</code> is similar to using
<em>rear</em>.  In both cases, the <em>front</em> won't move.  With the
count, we'll have to use <em>count</em> to calculate at which position
to add new values, making sure to wrap around the array if necessary.
Similarly, with a <em>rear</em> we have to make sure the rear moves
properly and wraps around.

<p>
</p></li><li>Using the <em>count</em> in <code>Delete()</code> is not more
difficult than using <em>rear</em>.  In both cases, the <em>front</em>
has to move (and wrap around when necessary).

</li></ul>

<p>
Given these differences, we'll choose the representation with a
<em>count</em>.

</p><p>
</p></font></li><li><font color="#ee0000">
<b>C implementation:</b><p>

Now, think about how to actually implement this queue in C.  Again,
we're implementing a queue of <em>characters</em>.

</p><p>
Since we put data structures in their own modules, we'll want to
create the source files <code>queue.h</code> and <code>queue.c</code>.

</p><p>
The operations needed for our queue are mainly determined by the
operations provided by an <em>abstract queue</em>, namely:

</p><blockquote><pre>QueueEnter()
QueueDelete()
QueueIsEmpty()
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
However, as we've seen, we also need additional operations for
<em>setup</em> and <em>cleanup</em> since we are implementing the queue
in a programming language. In addition, we need to be able to test
fullness for this <em>finite</em> queue.  We'll introduce these extra
operations when we know more about how we will implement the queue.

</p><p>
<em>Now, before we ponder the details of the queue operations, what
must we decide on?</em>

</p><p>
</p></font></li><li><font color="#ee0000">
<b>Organization of data types for a queue:</b><p>

Our goal is to have a type for a queue, so that people using our queue
can define queue variables, and pass them to queue functions.  For
example, we'd like to do something like the following:

</p><blockquote><pre><em>type-of-a-queue</em> q1, q2;
char ch;

/* Setup queues. */

QueueEnter(<em>ref-to-q1</em>, 'a');
QueueEnter(<em>ref-to-q2</em>, 'b');

ch = QueueDelete(<em>ref-to-q1</em>);

/* Cleanup queues. */
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
However, we'll also want to <em>abstract</em> the type of an
<em>element</em>.

</p><p>
Let's consider the organization of types between our queue module
files:

</p><blockquote><pre>queue.h				queue.c
-------				-------
				#include "queue.h"

type-of-an-element

type-of-a-queue
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The <em>interface</em> (<code>.h</code>) for the queue will need to
have a type for the queue (for people to define queue variables) and
the type of an element (for functional prototypes)...

</p><p>
However, while people using the queue will need to know the
<em>type-of-a-queue</em>, and thus, it will need to be in the header
file, we want to hide any of the <em>internals</em> of the
<em>type-of-a-queue</em> in the <code>.c</code> file.  Thus, the
<em>type-of-a-queue</em> is broken up into an <em>abstract</em> and
<em>concrete</em> part.

</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>The <em>concrete</em> part is a structure with all the pieces
of data needed for a queue, which is hidden in the implementation.
(Remember that we isolate this type from users of the queue, i.e., they
do not need to know that the queue is implemented with an array.
Furthermore, isolating the type will prevent them from being able to
mess up the queue.)

<p>
</p></li><li>The <em>abstract</em> part that is a pointer to such a structure,
which is publicly available to users of a queue.

</li></ul>

<p>
Therefore, our goal is to have the following:

</p><blockquote><pre>queue.h				queue.c
-------				-------
				#include "queue.h"

type-of-an-element

abstract-type-of-a-queue	concrete-type-of-a-queue
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We'll get the types from <code>queue.h</code> in <code>queue.c</code>
since we always include the header for a module in the
<em>implementation</em> (<code>.c</code>) part of the module.

</p><p>
</p></font></li><li><font color="#ee0000">
<b>ADTs and CDTs:</b><p>

</p><p>
Let's start filling in the types for a queue.  First, we want to write
a queue that is very generic.  The fact that this queue holds a
character is only particular to this program.  It should be easy to
change the type of things held in the queue.

</p><p>
Let's introduce a type name things held in the queue:

</p><blockquote><pre>typedef char queueElementT;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This will go in the header file, since we need it for the
queue function prototypes.

</p><p>
Next, we need something that holds all the information needed to keep
track of the queue.  We already decided that we will use an
<em>array</em>, <em>front index</em> and <em>count</em>.

</p><p>
<em>What construct will we use to combine these 3 fields
into a single type?</em>

</p><p><b>Answer:</b> A <code>struct</code>, which becomes our
<em>concrete-type-of-a-queue</em>, <code>struct queueCDT</code>:

</p><blockquote><pre>typedef struct queueCDT {
  queueElementT contents[MAX_QUEUE_SIZE];
  int front;
  int count;
} queueCDT;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
and goes in the implementation file.  Now, in the header file, we must
fill in what the <em>abstract-type-of-a-queue</em> is as follows:

</p><blockquote><pre>typedef struct queueCDT *queueADT;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Finally, we have:

</p><pre>queue.h                         queue.c
-------                         -------
				#include "queue.h"

typedef char queueElementT;	#define MAX_QUEUE_SIZE  100

typedef struct queueCDT		typedef struct queueCDT {
	*queueADT;		  queueElementT contents[MAX_QUEUE_SIZE];
				  int front;
				  int count;
				} queueCDT;
</pre>
